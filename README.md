Woodlanders Launcher is a JavaFX desktop app for the
[Woodlanders](https://gcclinux.github.io/Woodlanders/) game. It automatically
checks for updates, downloads the latest client from GitHub releases, caches it
locally, and launches the game with a single click.

## Features

- ✅ **Automatic Updates** — checks GitHub for the latest game version
- ✅ **Smart Caching** — downloads and caches game files to `${HOME}/.config/woodlanders/`
- ✅ **Version Detection** — compares local and remote versions with SHA-256
- ✅ **One-Click Launch** — simple, intuitive interface to play
- ✅ **Cross-Platform** — Windows and Linux (Snap/TAR.GZ)

See [`docs/QUICK_START.md`](docs/QUICK_START.md) for more.

## About the Game (Early Alpha)

You wake beneath a quiet pixel sky—no prophecy to follow, no quest log to obey—just wind over grass, rain that sometimes drifts in, birds crossing the horizon, and a compass that remembers where you began. This is Woodlanders in its earliest form: an open, living sandbox still knitting itself together night by night.

### What Doesn’t Exist Yet

- No scripted lore
- No story campaign
- No endgame arc

Instead: a procedural world, emerging systems, trees that fall and return, hunger that presses forward, bamboo that begins as a promise and grows if you give it time.

> Every mechanic you touch is a foundation stone. Every small imperfection is an invitation.

### How Builds Work

- 🧩 Minimal installer: one download
- 🔍 Auto-checks for new versions
- 🌒 Evening + daily pushes: sometimes subtle tuning, sometimes new possibilities
- 🧭 You’re ahead of the map — your feedback carves the path

### What to Expect

| Don’t Expect     | Do Expect  |
|------------------|------------|
| Polish           | Potential  |
| Finished loops   | Change     |
| Full narrative   | Emergence  |
| Packed world     | Quiet moments |

Moments where the world feels sparse—and others where sudden rain or a line of birds makes it feel briefly alive. That contrast is the frontier.

### Your Impact

If you explore, plant, test, nudge the edges, and tell us what you felt—you help shape what comes next:

- 🔨 Crafting
- 🏗️ Building
- 🌅 Day/Night cycle
- 🐾 Creatures
- 🔊 Sound & ambience
- 📖 Future story arcs

**Woodlanders isn’t finished — it’s becoming.**

> Join early. Wander freely. Grow it with us.

**Tagline**: Woodlanders — not a story yet, just the dawn before one.

> 🐦 Optional share: “I’m playing Woodlanders in its alpha dawn—no story yet, just systems waking up. Exploring while it learns to become a world.”

## Quick Start

### Windows (Recommended)

1. **Download** the installer package:
   - [`woodlanders-launcher-windows-installer-0.1.0.zip`](https://github.com/gcclinux/woodlanders-launcher/releases/latest)
2. **Extract** and run `INSTALL.bat`
3. **Launch** from desktop shortcut or Start Menu

### Windows un-install (Administrator PowerShell)

```
PowerShell 7.5.4
PS C:\Windows\System32> 

Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Woodlanders" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\Woodlanders Launcher.lnk" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Woodlanders" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.cache\woodlanders-javafx" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Write-Host "Clean uninstall complete" -ForegroundColor Green
```

The installer will automatically download Java if you don't have it installed.

### Windows (Manual — Java Required)

1. **Download**: [`woodlanders-launcher-windows-0.1.0.zip`](https://github.com/gcclinux/woodlanders-launcher/releases/latest)
2. **Require**: Java 21+ from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/)
3. **Extract** and double-click `launcher.bat`

### Linux (Snap — Easiest)

```bash
# Install the snap package
sudo snap install --dangerous woodlanders-launcher_0.1.0_amd64.snap

# Grant necessary permissions
sudo snap connect woodlanders-launcher:home
sudo snap connect woodlanders-launcher:network

# Launch
snap run woodlanders-launcher
```

### Linux (TAR.GZ — Manual)

```bash
# Install Java if not already installed
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre  # Debian/Ubuntu
# or
sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk  # Fedora

# Extract and run
tar -xzf woodlanders-launcher-linux-0.1.0.tar.gz
cd woodlanders-launcher-linux-0.1.0
chmod +x launcher.sh
./launcher.sh
```

## System Requirements

### Windows
- OS: Windows 10 or later
- Java: Not required (installer auto-downloads Java 21)
- Disk Space: ~200 MB (including Java runtime)

### Linux
- OS: Any modern Linux distribution
- Java: JRE 21+ (not needed for Snap package)
- Disk Space: ~200 MB

---

## How It Works

1. **Launch** the launcher application
2. Launcher checks GitHub for the latest Woodlanders client release
3. If a new version is available, it's automatically downloaded
4. Click **"Launch Game"** to start playing
5. Game files are cached locally for faster subsequent launches

---

## Building from Source

See [`docs/BUILD_GUIDE.md`](docs/BUILD_GUIDE.md) for detailed build instructions.

```bash
# Build all distribution packages
gradle :app:buildAllPackages

# Run locally for testing
gradle run
```

---

## Configuration

Game files and cache are stored in:
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\woodlanders\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/woodlanders/`
- **JavaFX Cache**: `~/.cache/woodlanders-javafx/`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Windows: "Java is not recognized"
- The installer package automatically handles Java installation
- For manual installation, download Java from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/)

### Linux: Application won't start
- Ensure Java 21+ is installed: `java -version`
- For Snap: Check permissions with `snap connections woodlanders-launcher`

### Game won't download
- Check your internet connection
- Verify GitHub is accessible
- Check logs in the application console
